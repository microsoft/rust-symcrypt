# SymCrypt on Rust

## Introduction

Within this repository, there are 2 crates:

1. **symcrypt-sys**: Modified Rust/C FFI bindings over SymCrypt.
2. **symcrypt**: Provides friendly Rust wrappers over `symcrypt-sys`.


The purpose of these crates is to bring FIPS-compliant cryptography to the Rust Ecosystem.
